## Assignment Title: Problem Solving with Function, Recursion & Array in C



##  Description:
This assignment focuses on solving various real-life and logical problems using the C programming language, with a special emphasis on Functions, Recursion, and Arrays. Each program is designed to enhance understanding of core programming concepts and demonstrate how they can be applied to break down and solve problems effectively.

Functions are used to divide the code into smaller, manageable parts, making the code cleaner, more organized, and reusable. Recursion is implemented to solve problems like factorial calculation and Fibonacci series in a concise and elegant manner. Arrays are used to store and manipulate collections of data, allowing operations such as insertion, deletion, searching, and sorting.

Overall, this assignment serves as a practical exercise for students to strengthen their analytical thinking, problem-solving skills, and understanding of foundational programming techniques.


## 💡 Key Concepts Used:
(i) Functions: Used to break the program into smaller, reusable blocks for better modularity and clarity.

(ii) Recursion: Applied to solve problems that can be broken down into smaller sub-problems, such as factorial and Fibonacci series.

(iii) Arrays: Used to store multiple values efficiently and perform operations like traversal, insertion, deletion, and searching.

(iv) Loops (for, while): Employed for repeated execution of tasks, especially in array processing and iterative logic.

(v) Conditional Statements (if-else, switch): Used to make decisions based on user input or data conditions.

(vi) User Input Handling: Taking input from users to make the program interactive and dynamic.

(vii) Basic Algorithmic Thinking: Implementing step-by-step logic to solve computational problems effectively.
